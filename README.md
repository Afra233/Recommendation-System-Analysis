## Dataset  
The dataset consists of:  
- **events.csv** – User interactions (views, add-to-cart, transactions)  
- **item_properties.csv** – Item attributes that change over time  
- **category_tree.csv** – Product category hierarchy  

## Project Tasks  
- **Task 1**: Predict item properties for "add to cart" events based on previous views  
- **Task 2**: Identify and filter out abnormal users to improve recommendation accuracy  

## Steps Involved  
1. **Data Preprocessing** – Clean and prepare dataset  
2. **Feature Engineering** – Extract meaningful insights  
3. **Model Training** – Implement recommendation algorithms  
4. **Evaluation** – Measure accuracy and relevance  
5. **Optimization** – Improve performance and scalability  

## Installation & Usage  
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/recommendation-system.git  
cd recommendation-system  
pip install -r requirements.txt  
python main.py  
```  

## Technologies Used  
- **Python** (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn)  
- **Machine Learning** (Collaborative filtering, content-based methods)
